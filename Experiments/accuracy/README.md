# Accuracy Experiments
As these experiments require quite a lot of iterating that can be parallelized, we implemented this experiment on a GPU. The sketch sizes evaluated are the ones we were able to achieve for an oversubscribed, regular, and pessimsitic architecture.

# Setup
Data sets and groundtruths are generated by our Makefile. You need to set the CUDA prefix environment variable to load all required input data, groundtruths, and compile the program.
```
export CUDA_PREFIX="/usr/local/cuda-11.5/bin"
make all
```

# Experiment
The experiment itself is started by executing
```
bash run_experiment.sh
```
This script runs for a couple of hours on an RTX 2080.

A CSV file for every real-world dataset is generated in this folder. The CSV file is structured as follows:
```
"rows", "cols", "full_count", "result_count", "result_sum", "result_min", "result_max"
```
